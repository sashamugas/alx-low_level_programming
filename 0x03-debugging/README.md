DEBUGGING
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing error in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it's important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.
